# Machine_learning_example

For the purposes of this exercise, let's pretend we're working for a startup that just got funded to create a smartphone app that automatically identifies species of flowers from pictures taken on the smartphone. We're working with a moderately-sized team of data scientists and will be building part of the data analysis pipeline for this app.

We've been tasked by our company's Head of Data Science to create a demo machine learning model that takes four measurements from the flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and identifies the species based on those measurements alone.
